            <div class="entry-content" style="max-width:900px; text-align: left; margin: auto;">
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  I am originally from East Jordan, Michigan. After graduating high school,
                  I attended Michigan Technological University to study physics. While strongly interested in physics,
                  I was also passionate about cycling. Much of my free time and summers were spent training and racing.
                  During my final year at Michigan Tech, I had the opportunity to race for a professional team, BISSELL Pro Cycling.
                  After graduating, I decided that I would pursue cycling full time. If there was ever a time to race professionally,
                  it was now or never. Physics would be waiting for me when I was ready.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  After a season with BISSELL Pro Cyling, I moved to the BISSELL-ABG-Giant Cycling team. Having finished school,
                  I was free to direct my full attention toward cycling. Moving away from the snowy winter of Michgan
                  to Greenville, SC, I was able to train year round and compete at races throughout the US where I could showcase
                  my abilities to higher level teams. By the end of the season I was able to get a handful of notable results, attracting
                  the attention of one of the top professional teams in the US, Holowesko|Citadel Racing Team.
                  I signed on to race for them the following season.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">

                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  I spent 3 years racing for Holowesko|Citadel. It was an incredible experience. I was on a 6 rider roster that won the 2015
                  US Team Time Trial National Championship, which also allowed us to compete at the 2015 World Championships. I've been on the podium at
                  national level races, and I've had the opportunity to race against some of the best cyclists in the world. Through cycling I was able to develop
                  a strong work ethic, teamwork, and discipline. However, I have felt restless to do more than just race. At the same time I have found the
                  developments in artificial intelligence extremely exciting. Making use of the strong mathematical and technical foundations
                  I developed in my physics education, and the abundance of resources freely available online,
                  I have been teaching myself machine learning with the goal of beginning a career in the field.
