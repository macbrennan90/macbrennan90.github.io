            <div class="entry-content" style="max-width:900px; text-align: left; margin: auto;">
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  I am originally from East Jordan, Michigan. After graduating high school,
                  I went to Michigan Technological University where I studied physics. While I was
                  strongly interested in physics, I was also passionate about cycling, and much of my
                  free time and summers were spent training and racing. During my final year at Michigan Tech,
                  I had the opportunity to race for a professional team, BISSELL Pro Cycling. So after graduating,
                  I decided that I would pursue cycling full time. If I ever wanted to race professionally,
                  it was now or never. Physics would be waiting for me when I was ready.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  Unfortunately, I had a pretty rough first season with several hard crashes, limited racing, and on top of that,
                  the BISSELL Pro Cyling team dissolved at the end of the season. This left me without a team or many
                  options to continue racing. Luckily my former team, BISSELL-ABG-Giant, was still operating and happy to have me back.
                  While they were not a registered pro team, they were able to give me a small stipend and professional level support,
                  giving me the opportunity to continue racing at a high level. I knew it would be a challenge, but I was determined to give a full year,
                  100% focused on cycling, with the goal of getting back onto a professional team.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  Having finished school, I was free to direct my full attention toward cycling. I moved away from the snowy winter of Michgan
                  to Greenville, SC, where I could train year round. With the support of BISSELL-ABG-Giant, I was able to compete at high level races
                  throughout the US where I could showcase my abilities to bigger teams. By the end of the season I was able to get a handful of
                  notable results, which attracted the attention of one of the top professional teams in the US, Holowesko|Citadel Racing Team.
                  I signed on to race for them the following season.
                </p>
                <p style="text-indent: 30px;">
                  I spent 3 years racing for Holowesko|Citadel. It was an incredible experience. I was on a 6 rider roster that won the 2015
                  US Team Time Trial National Championship, which also allowed us to compete at the 2015 World Championships. I've been on the podium at
                  national level races, and I've had the opportunity to races against some of the sports best athletes. However, I have felt restless
                  to do more than just race. At the same time I have found the developments in artificial intelligence extremely exciting. Making use of the
                  strong mathematical and technical foundations I developed in my physics education, and the abundance of resources freely available online,
                  I have been teaching myself machine learning with the goal of beginning a career in the field.
